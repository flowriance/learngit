# Introduction

## Purpose

The purpose of the Iteration Test Plan is to gather all of the
information necessary to plan and control the test effort for a given
iteration. It describes the approach to testing the software, and is the
top-level plan generated and used by managers to direct the test effort.

This *Test Plan* for the supports the following objectives:

• \[Identifies the items that should be targeted by the tests.

• Identifies the motivation for and ideas behind the test areas to be
covered.

• Outlines the testing approach that will be used.

• Identifies the required resources and provides an estimate of the test
efforts.

• Lists the deliverable elements of the test project.\]

## Scope

\[Describe the levels of testingfor example, Unit, Integration, or
Systemand the types of testingsuch as Functionality, Usability,
Reliability, Performance, and Supportabilitythat will be addressed by
this **Test Plan**. It is also important to provide a general indication
of significant areas that will be **excluded** from scope, especially
where the intended audience might otherwise reasonably assume the
inclusion of those areas.

**Note**: Avoid placing detail here that you will repeat in sections 3,
Target Test Items, and 4,Outline of Planned Tests.\]

## Intended Audience

\[Provide a brief description of the audience for whom you are writing
the **Test Plan**. This helps readers of your document identify whether
it is a document intended for their use, and helps prevent the document
from being used inappropriately.

**Note**: Document style and content often alters in relation to the
intended audience.

This section should only be about three to five paragraphs in length.\]

## Document Terminology and Acronyms

\[This subsection provides the definitions of any terms, acronyms, and
abbreviations required to properly interpret the **Test Plan**. Avoid
listing items that are generally applicable to the project as a whole
and that are already defined in the project’s Glossary. Include a
reference to the project’s Glossary in the References section.\]

##  References

\[This subsection provides a list of the documents referenced elsewhere
within the **Test Plan**. Identify each document by title, version (or
report number if applicable), date, and publishing organization or
original author. Avoid listing documents that are influential but not
directly referenced. Specify the sources from which the “official
versions” of the references can be obtained, such as intranet UNC names
or document reference codes. This information may be provided by
reference to an appendix or to another document.\]

## Document Structure

\[This subsection outlines what the rest of the **Test Plan** contains
and gives an introduction to how the rest of the document is organized.
This section may be eliminated if a Table of Contents is used.\]

# Evaluation Mission and Test Motivation

\[Provide an overview of the mission and motivation for the testing that
will be conducted in this iteration.\]

## Background

\[Provide a brief description of the background surrounding why the test
effort defined by this **Test Plan** will be undertaken. Include
information such as the key problem being solved, the major benefits of
the solution, the planned architecture of the solution, and a brief
history of the project. Where this information is defined in other
documents, you can include references to those other more detailed
documents if appropriate. This section should only be about three to
five paragraphs in length.\]

## Evaluation Mission

\[Provide a brief statement that defines the mission for the evaluation
effort in the current iteration. This statement might incorporate one or
more concerns including:

  - find as many bugs as possible

  - find important problems, assess perceived quality risks

  - advise about perceived project risks

  - certify to a standard

  - verify a specification (requirements, design or claims)

  - advise about product quality, satisfy stakeholders

  - advise about testing

  - fulfill process mandates

  - and so forth

Each mission provides a different context to the test effort and alters
the way in which testing should be approached.\]

## Test Motivators

\[Provide an outline of the key elements that will motivate the testing
effort in this iteration. Testing will be motivated by many
thingsquality risks, technical risks, project risks, use cases,
functional requirements, non-functional requirements, design elements,
suspected failures or faults, change requests, and so forth.\]

# Target Test Items

The listing below identifies those test itemssoftware, hardware, and
supporting product elements that have been identified as targets for
testing. This list represents what items will be tested.

\[Provide a high level list of the major target test items. This list
should include both items produced directly by the project development
team, and items that those products rely on; for example, basic
processor hardware, peripheral devices, operating systems, third-party
products or components, and so forth. Consider grouping the list by
category and assigning relative importance to each motivator.\]

# Outline of Planned Tests

\[This section provides a high-level outline of the testing that will be
performed. The outline in this section represents a high level overview
of both the tests that will be performed and those that will not.\]

## Outline of Test Inclusions

\[Provide a high level outline of the major testing planned for the
current iteration. Note what will be included in the plan and record
what will explicitly **not** be included in the section titled Outline
of Test Exclusions.\]

## Outline of Other Candidates for Potential Inclusion

\[Separately outline test areas you suspect might be useful to
investigate and evaluate, but that have not been sufficiently researched
to know if they are important to pursue.\]

## Outline of Test Exclusions

\[Provide a high level outline of the potential tests that might have
been conducted but that have been **explicitly excluded** from this
plan. If a type of test will not be implemented and executed, indicate
this in a sentence stating the test will not be implemented or executed
and stating the justification, such as:

  - “These tests do not help achieve the evaluation mission.”

  - “There are insufficient resources to conduct these tests.”

  - “These tests are unnecessary due to the testing conducted by xxxx.”

As a heuristic, if you think it would be reasonable for one of your
audience members to expect a certain aspect of testing to be included
that you will not or cannot address, you should note it’s exclusion: If
the team agrees the exclusion is obvious, you probably don’t need to
list it.\]

# Test Approach

\[The Test Approach presents the recommended strategy for designing and
implementing the required tests. Sections 3, Target Test Items, and 4,
Outline of Planned Tests, identified **what** items will be tested and
**what** types of tests would be performed. This section describes
**how** the tests will be realized.

One aspect to consider for the test approach is the techniques to be
used. This should include an outline of how each technique can be
implemented, both from a manual and/or an automated perspective, and the
criterion for knowing that the technique is useful and successful. For
each technique, provide a description of the technique and define why it
is an important part of the test approach by briefly outlining how it
helps achieve the Evaluation Mission or addresses the Test Motivators.

Another aspect to discuss in this section is the Fault or Failure models
that are applicable and ways to approach evaluating them.

As you define each aspect of the approach, you should update Section 10,
Responsibilities, Staffing, and Training Needs, to document the test
environment configuration and other resources that will be needed to
implement each aspect.\]

## Initial Test-Idea Catalogs and Other Reference Sources

\[Provide a listing of existing resources that will be referenced to
stimulate the identification and selection of specific tests to be
conducted. An example Test-Ideas Catalog is provided in the examples
section of RUP.\]

## Testing Techniques and Types

### Data and Database Integrity Testing

\[The databases and the database processes should be tested as an
independent subsystem. This testing should test the subsystems without
the target-of-test’s User Interface as the interface to the data.
Additional research into the DataBase Management System (DBMS) needs to
be performed to identify the tools and techniques that may exist to
support the testing identified in the following table.\]

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Technique Objective:</th>
<th>[Exercise database access methods and processes independent of the UI so you can observe and log incorrect functioning target behavior or data corruption.]</th>

</ul></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Function Testing

\[Function testing of the target-of-test should focus on any
requirements for test that can be traced directly to use cases or
business functions and business rules. The goals of these tests are to
verify proper data acceptance, processing, and retrieval, and the
appropriate implementation of the business rules. This type of testing
is based upon black box techniques; that is verifying the application
and its internal processes by interacting with the application via the
Graphical User Interface (GUI) and analyzing the output or results. The
following table identifies an outline of the testing recommended for
each application.\]

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

###   
Business Cycle Testing

\[Business Cycle Testing should emulate the activities performed on the
over time. A period should be identified, such as one year, and
transactions and activities that would occur during a year’s period
should be executed. This includes all daily, weekly, and monthly cycles,
and events that are date-sensitive, such as ticklers.\]

<table>

<tr class="header">

<ul>
<li><p>The tests used for target-of-test’s function testing will be modified or enhanced to increase the number of times each function is executed to simulate several different users over a specified period.</p></li>
<li><p>All time or date-sensitive functions will be executed using valid and invalid dates or time periods.</p></li>
<li><p>All functions that occur on a periodic schedule will be executed or launched at the appropriate time.</p></li>

###   
User Interface Testing

\[User Interface (UI) testing verifies a user’s interaction with the
software. The goal of UI testing is to ensure that the UI provides the
user with the appropriate access and navigation through the functions of
the target-of-test. In addition, UI testing ensures that the objects
within the UI function as expected and conform to corporate or industry
standards.\]

### Performance Profiling 

\[Performance profiling is a performance test in which response times,
transaction rates, and other time-sensitive requirements are measured
and evaluated. The goal of Performance Profiling is to verify
performance requirements have been achieved. Performance profiling is
implemented and executed to profile and tune a target-of-test's
performance behaviors as a function of conditions such as workload or
hardware configurations.

**Note**: Transactions in the following table refer to “logical business
transactions”. These transactions are defined as specific use cases that
an actor of the system is expected to perform using the target-of-test,
such as add or modify a given contract.\]

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Technique Objective:</th>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Special Considerations:</td>
<td><p>[Comprehensive performance testing includes having a background workload on the server.</p>
<p>There are several methods that can be used to perform this, including:</p>
<p>• “Drive transactions” directly to the server, usually in the form of Structured Query Language (SQL) calls.</p>
<p>• Create “virtual” user load to simulate many clients, usually several hundred. Remote Terminal Emulation tools are used to accomplish this load. This technique can also be used to load the network with “traffic”.</p>
<p>• Use multiple physical clients, each running test scripts, to place a load on the system.</p>
<p>Performance testing should be performed on a dedicated machine or at a dedicated time. This permits full control and accurate measurement.</p>
<p>The databases used for Performance Testing should be either actual size or scaled equally.]</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Load Testing

\[Load testing is a performance test that subjects the target-of-test to
varying workloads to measure and evaluate the performance behaviors and
abilities of the target-of-test to continue to function properly under
these different workloads. The goal of load testing is to determine and
ensure that the system functions properly beyond the expected maximum
workload. Additionally, load testing evaluates the performance
characteristics, such as response times, transaction rates, and other
time-sensitive issues).\]

\[**Note**: Transactions in the following table refer to “logical
business transactions”. These transactions are defined as specific
functions that an end user of the system is expected to perform using
the application, such as add or modify a given contract.\]

### Stress Testing

\[Stress testing is a type of performance test implemented and executed
to understand how a system fails due to conditions at the boundary, or
outside of, the expected tolerances. This typically involves low
resources or competition for resources. Low resource conditions reveal
how the target-of-test fails that is not apparent under normal
conditions. Other defects might result from competition for shared
resources, like database locks or network bandwidth, although some of
these tests are usually addressed under functional and load testing.\]

logical business transactions.\]

###   
Volume Testing

\[Volume testing subjects the target-of-test to large amounts of data to
determine if limits are reached that cause the software to fail. Volume
testing also identifies the continuous maximum load or volume the
target-of-test can handle for a given period. For example, if the
target-of-test is processing a set of database records to generate a
report, a Volume Test would use a large test database, and would check
that the software behaved normally and produced the correct report.\]

###   
Security and Access Control Testing

\[Security and Access Control Testing focuses on two key areas of
security:

• Application-level security, including access to the Data or Business
Functions

• System-level Security, including logging into or remotely accessing to
the system.

Based on the security you want, application-level security ensures that
actors are restricted to specific functions or use cases, or they are
limited in the data that is available to them. For example, everyone may
be permitted to enter data and create new accounts, but only managers
can delete them. If there is security at the data level, testing ensures
that “user type one” can see all customer information, including
financial data, however, “user two” only sees the demographic data for
the same client.

System-level security ensures that only those users granted access to
the system are capable of accessing the applications and only through
the appropriate gateways.\]

<th>Technique Objective:</th>
<th><p>[Exercise the target-of-test under the following conditions to observe and log target behavior:</p>

### Failover and Recovery Testing

\[Failover and recovery testing ensures that the target-of-test can
successfully failover and recover from a variety of hardware, software
or network malfunctions with undue loss of data or data integrity.

For those systems that must be kept running failover testing ensures
that, when a failover condition occurs, the alternate or backup systems
properly “take over” for the failed system without any loss of data or
transactions.

Recovery testing is an antagonistic test process in which the
application or system is exposed to extreme conditions, or simulated
conditions, to cause a failure, such as device Input/Output (I/O)
failures, or invalid database pointers and keys. Recovery processes are
invoked, and the application or system is monitored and inspected to
verify proper application, or system, and data recovery has been
achieved.\]

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Technique Objective:</th>
<th><p>[Simulate the failure conditions and exercise the recovery processes (manual and automated) to restore the database, applications, and system to a desired, known, state. The following types of conditions are included in the testing to observe and log target behavior after recovery:</p>
<p>• power interruption to the client</p>
<p>• power interruption to the server</p>
<p>• communication interruption via network servers</p>
<p>• interruption, communication, or power loss to DASD (Dynamic Access Storage Devices) and DASD controllers</p>
<p>• incomplete cycles (data filter processes interrupted, data synchronization processes interrupted)</p>
<p>• invalid database pointers or keys</p>
<p>• invalid or corrupted data elements in database]</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Technique:</td>
<td><p>[The tests already created for Function and Business Cycle testing can be used as a basis for creating a series of transactions to support failover and recovery testing, primarily to define the tests to be run to test that recovery was successful.</p>
<p>• Power interruption to the client: power the PC down.</p>
<p>• Power interruption to the server: simulate or initiate power down procedures for the server.</p>
<p>• Interruption via network servers: simulate or initiate communication loss with the network (physically disconnect communication wires or power down network servers or routers).</p>
<p>• Interruption, communication, or power loss to DASD and DASD controllers: simulate or physically eliminate communication with one or more DASDs or controllers.</p>
<p>Once the above conditions or simulated conditions are achieved, additional transactions should be executed and, upon reaching this second test point state, recovery procedures should be invoked.</p>
<p>Testing for incomplete cycles uses the same technique as described above except that the database processes themselves should be aborted or prematurely terminated.</p>
<p>Testing for the following conditions requires that a known database state be achieved.</p>
<p>Several database fields, pointers, and keys should be corrupted manually and directly within the database (via database tools). Additional transactions should be executed using the tests from Application Function and Business Cycle Testing and full cycles executed.]</p></td>

### Configuration Testing

\[Configuration testing verifies the operation of the target-of-test on
different software and hardware configurations. In most production
environments, the particular hardware specifications for the client
workstations, network connections, and database servers vary. Client
workstations may have different software loadedfor example,
applications, drivers, and so onand, at any one time, many different
combinations may be active using different resources.\]

### Installation Testing

\[Installation testing has two purposes. The first is to ensure that the
software can be installed under different conditionssuch as a new
installation, an upgrade, and a complete or custom installationunder
normal and abnormal conditions. Abnormal conditions include insufficient
disk space, lack of privilege to create directories, and so on. The
second purpose is to verify that, once installed, the software operates
correctly. This usually means running a number of the tests that were
developed for Function Testing.\]

### Traceability Matrices

\[Using a tool such as Rational RequisistePro or MS Excel, provide one
or more matrices of traceability relationships between traced items.\]

# Testing Workflow

\[Provide an outline of the workflow to be followed by the Test team in
the development and execution of this **Test Plan**.\]

The specific testing workflow that you will use should be documented
separately in the project's Development Case. It should explain how the
project has customized the base RUP test workflow (typically on a
phase-by-phase basis). In most cases, we recommend you place a reference
in this section of the **Test Plan** to the relevant section of the
Development Case. It might be both useful and sufficient to simply
include a diagram or image depicting your test workflow.

More specific details of the individual testing tasks are defined in a
number of different ways, depending on project culture; for example:

  - defined as a list of tasks in this section of the **Test Plan**, or
    in an accompanying appendix

  - defined in a central project schedule (often in a scheduling tool
    such as Microsoft Project)

  - documented in individual, "dynamic" to-do lists for each team
    member, which are usually too detailed to be placed in the **Test
    Plan**

  - documented on a centrally located whiteboard and updated dynamically

  - not formally documented at all

Based on your project culture, you should either list your specific
testing tasks here or provide some descriptive text explaining the
process your team uses to handle detailed task planning and provide a
reference to where the details are stored, if appropriate.

For Master Test Plans, we recommend avoiding detailed task planning,
which is often an unproductive effort if done as a front-loaded activity
at the beginning of the project. A Master Test Plan might usefully
describe the phases and the number of iterations, and give an indication
of what types of testing are generally planned for each Phase or
Iteration.

**Note**: Where process and detailed planning information is recorded
centrally and separately from this Test Plan, you will have to manage
the issues that will arise from having duplicate copies of the same
information. To avoid team members referencing out-of-date information,
we suggest that in this situation you place the minimum amount of
process and planning information within the Test Plan to make ongoing
maintenance easier and simply reference the "Master" source material.\]

## Staffing and Training Needs

This section outlines how to approach staffing and training the test
roles for the project.

\[The way to approach staffing and training will vary from project to
project. If this section is part of a Master Test Plan, you should
indicate at what points in the project lifecycle different skills and
numbers of staff are needed. If this is an Iteration Test Plan, you
should focus mainly on where and what training might occur during the
Iteration.

Give thought to your training needs, and plan to schedule this based on
a Just-In-Time (JIT) approach—there is often a temptation to attend
training too far in advance of its usage when the test team has apparent
slack. Doing this introduces the risk of the training being forgotten by
the time it's needed.

Look for opportunities to combine the purchase of productivity tools
with training on those tools, and arrange with the vendor to delay
delivery of the training until just before you need it. If you have
enough headcount, consider having training delivered in a customized
manner for you, possibly at your own site.

The test team often requires the support and skills of other team
members not directly part of the test team. Make sure you arrange in
your plan for appropriate availability of System Administrators,
Database Administrators, and Developers who are required to enable the
test effort.\]
